# 100DaysOfCode Challenge

This is my personal challenge to commit to coding for 100 consecutive days to enhance my programming skills, deepen my knowledge, and build practical projects. This challenge will be a significant step in my journey to becoming a better developer.

## Purpose
The purpose of this challenge is to:
- Improve my coding skills by consistently practicing and working on coding projects.
- Learn new technologies, frameworks, and programming languages.
- Build a strong coding habit and discipline.
- Share my progress, learnings, and insights with the coding community.

## Goals
During this challenge, I aim to:
- Complete at least one coding project from start to finish.
- Solve coding problems daily on platforms like LeetCode or HackerRank.
- Learn and implement new technologies or frameworks.
- Contribute to open-source projects.
- Document my progress and learnings on social media platforms.

## Guidelines
To ensure the success of this challenge, I will:
- Code for a minimum of one hour every day for 100 consecutive days.
- Focus on quality coding practices, including clean code, efficient algorithms, and proper documentation.
- Use version control (e.g., Git) to track my progress and manage project repositories.
- Engage with the coding community, ask questions, and seek feedback when needed.
- Share my progress and learnings on social media using the hashtag #100DaysOfCode.

## Project Repository
I will maintain a public repository on GitHub to track my progress and showcase my coding projects throughout this challenge. Feel free to explore the repository and provide feedback or suggestions.
